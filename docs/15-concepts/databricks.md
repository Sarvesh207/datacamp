# Databricks

Databricks was born out of the frustration of the Hadoop vendors and two Apache projects: Hadoop and Spark. Databricks is the commercial entity of Apache Spark. Apache Spark was born out of frustration with Apache Hadoop and the commercial vendors where only one is left: Cloudera. Hadoop does not do well with concurrency and it has huge latency issues. Apache MapReduce is dead and was replaced with Apache Spark to remedy these limitations. Apache Spark has problems of its own and thus Databricks was born to take Spark to Enterprise.
