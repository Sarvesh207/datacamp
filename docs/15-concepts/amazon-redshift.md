# Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service optimized for **online analytical processing** (**OLAP**) applications. You can start with just a few hundred **gigabytes** (**GB**) of data and scale to a **petabyte** (**PB**) or more. Designing your database for analytical processing lets you take full advantage of Amazon Redshift's columnar architecture.

An analytical schema forms the foundation of your data model. You can choose a star or snowflake schema by using Normalized, Denormalized, or Data Vault data modeling techniques. Redshift is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports a number of data model structures, including dimensional, denormalized, and aggregate (rollup) structures. This makes it optimal for analytics.
