## Lambda Layer

AWS Lambda layers allow the Lambda functions to import additional code or data without including that additional code in the deployment package.
A layer is a zip file that contains all the additional code. A layer can contain some third-party libraries, custom runtimes, or data, and you can refer to that layer from any lambda function.
