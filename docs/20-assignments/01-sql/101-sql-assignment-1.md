# SQL Assignment 1

1. Go to https://www.sql-practice.com/.
2. On the left side of the page, you will find 4 databases. Explore their schema.
3. Again on the left side, you will also find `Learning Resources` tab. Explore the section of this tab and learn the definitions. A group discussion and a viva will be conducted based on these concepts.
4. Now, on your right, you will find a `Start` button.
5. There are aroung 50 questions divided into three difficulty levels - easy, medium and hard. You have to practice these questions thoroughly. Estimated time is 1 min for easy, 3 min for medium and 8 min for hard.
6. Once you completed the practice questions, inform the instructor and you will receive a set of questions similar to the one you practiced. The databases would also be same. You would have to solve those questions yourself.
7. Once you finish all the questions in the provided set, submit it by creating a new PR and adding your solution `.sql` file at `assignments > baseskill > sql > assignment1 > johndoe_solution.sql`. Make sure to replace `johndoe` with your own name.
8. Inform the instructor about the PR and ask for review.
