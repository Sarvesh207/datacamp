## Setup

```py

spark.sql(f"USE {db}")

spark.sql("SET spark.databricks.delta.formatCheck.enabled = false")
spark.sql("SET spark.databricks.delta.properties.defaults.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite = true")

## Data Ingestion

The data used is a modified version of the public data from [Lending Club](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). It includes all funded loans from 2012 to 2017. Each loan includes applicant information provided by the applicant as well as the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. For a full view of the data please view the data dictionary available [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx).

```py
%sh mkdir -p /dbfs/tmp/delta_demo/loans_parquet/; wget -O /dbfs/tmp/delta_demo/loans_parquet/loans.parquet https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/SAISEU19-loan-risks.snappy.parquet

<summary>What is Delta Lake?</summary>

An open-source storage layer for data lakes that brings ACID transactions to Apache Sparkâ„¢ and big data workloads.

* **ACID Transactions**: Ensures data integrity and read consistency with complex, concurrent data pipelines.
* **Unified Batch and Streaming Source and Sink**: A table in Delta Lake is both a batch table, as well as a streaming source and sink. Streaming data ingest, batch historic backfill, and interactive queries all just work out of the box. 
* **Schema Enforcement and Evolution**: Ensures data cleanliness by blocking writes with unexpected.
* **Time Travel**: Query previous versions of the table by time or version number.
* **Deletes and upserts**: Supports deleting and upserting into tables with programmatic APIs.
* **Open Format**: Stored as Parquet format in blob storage.
* **Audit History**: History of all the operations that happened in the table.
* **Scalable Metadata management**: Able to handle millions of files are scaling the metadata operations with Spark.

## Conversion to Delta

Delta Lake is 100% compatible with Apache Spark&trade;, which makes it easy to get started with if you already use Spark for your big data workflows. Delta Lake features APIs for **SQL**, **Python**, and **Scala**, so that you can use it in whatever language you feel most comfortable in.

In **Python**: Read your data into a Spark DataFrame, then write it out in Delta Lake format directly, with no upfront schema definition needed.

```py
parquet_path = "file:/dbfs/tmp/delta_demo/loans_parquet/"

df = (spark.read.format("parquet").load(parquet_path)
      .withColumn("type", lit("batch"))
      .withColumn("timestamp", current_timestamp()))

df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("loans_delta")
```

**SQL:** Use `CREATE TABLE` statement with SQL (no upfront schema definition needed)

```py
%sql
CREATE TABLE loans_delta2
USING delta
AS SELECT * FROM parquet.`/tmp/delta_demo/loans_parquet`
```

**SQL**: Use `CONVERT TO DELTA` to convert Parquet files to Delta Lake format in place

```py
%sql CONVERT TO DELTA parquet.`/tmp/delta_demo/loans_parquet`
```

## View the data in the Delta Lake table

**How many records are there, and what does the data look like?**

```py
spark.sql("select count(*) from loans_delta").show()
spark.sql("select * from loans_delta").show(3)
```

## Unified batch + streaming data processing with multiple concurrent readers and writers

:::tip
Write 2 different data streams into our Delta Lake table at the same time.
:::

```py
# Set up 2 streaming writes to our table
stream_query_A = generate_and_append_data_stream(table_format="delta", table_name="loans_delta", schema_ok=True, type='stream A')
stream_query_B = generate_and_append_data_stream(table_format="delta", table_name="loans_delta", schema_ok=True, type='stream B')

# Create 2 continuous streaming readers of our Delta Lake table to illustrate streaming progress

# Streaming read #1
display(spark.readStream.format("delta").table("loans_delta").groupBy("type").count().orderBy("type"))

# Streaming read #2
display(spark.readStream.format("delta").table("loans_delta").groupBy("type", window("timestamp", "10 seconds")).count().orderBy("window"))
```

Add a batch query, just for good measure

```py
%sql
SELECT addr_state, COUNT(*)
FROM loans_delta
GROUP BY addr_state
```

```py
dbutils.notebook.exit("stop")
stop_all_streams()
```

## ACID Transactions

```py
%sql DESCRIBE HISTORY loans_delta
```

## Use Schema Enforcement to protect data quality

To show you how schema enforcement works, let's create a new table that has an extra column -- `credit_score` -- that doesn't match our existing Delta Lake table schema.

**Write DataFrame with extra column, `credit_score`, to Delta Lake table**

```py
# Generate `new_data` with additional column
new_column = [StructField("credit_score", IntegerType(), True)]
new_schema = StructType(spark.table("loans_delta").schema.fields + new_column)
data = [(99997, 10000, 1338.55, "CA", "batch", datetime.now(), 649),
        (99998, 20000, 1442.55, "NY", "batch", datetime.now(), 702)]

new_data = spark.createDataFrame(data, new_schema)
new_data.printSchema()
```

```py
# Uncommenting this cell will lead to an error because the schemas don't match.
# Attempt to write data with new column to Delta Lake table
new_data.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("loans_delta")
```

**Schema enforcement helps keep our tables clean and tidy so that we can trust the data we have stored in Delta Lake.** The writes above were blocked because the schema of the new data did not match the schema of table (see the exception details). See more information about how it works [here](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/09/24/diving-into-delta-lake-schema-enforcement-evolution.html).

## Use Schema Evolution to add new columns to schema

If we *want* to update our Delta Lake table to match this data source's schema, we can do so using schema evolution. Simply add the following to the Spark write command: `.option("mergeSchema", "true")`

```py
new_data.write.format("delta").mode("append").option("mergeSchema", "true").saveAsTable("loans_delta")
```

```py
%sql SELECT * FROM loans_delta WHERE loan_id IN (99997, 99998)
```
